# CS50x - Final Project - Web App - 4SHARE

The final project is a web app where users can store in an organized and a structured way important things watched or read. I wanted to make this project because it is certainly one tool that I would use regularly mainly because our information era, which we are surronded of information.

Technologies used:
- Python (Flask)
- JavaScript (JQuery)
- Sqlite
- CSS (Bootstrap & DataTable)
- HTML

## How the web app works?

The idea is simple. The user can create different tables to store different informations. For instance: "The best movies of my life", "The best movies of 2022", "Books Read in 2022", "Courses" so on..

After you create your table, you can post it in a section that anyone who has account can vote. That feature is pretty important and I missed a tool similar than that when I started studying programming. It would be awesome if someone who had started programming lately and had achieved a good place in this area had written his or her path.  

### Database

Database stores all users, tables and vote checkers. They are organized in a way that they are associate with each other.

## Possible improvements

- It is possible to store images
- The user has more control in each information that he want to appear
- Users can generate columns as their need
- Connect the web app with e-mail
